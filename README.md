### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I started programming doing most of all competitive programming with the languages C/C++. Because of that, I acquired a love for being face-to-face with hard problems that made me lose sleep. I also like concurrent programming and distributed systems which is the reason why I chose Go as one of my main languages.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for a job.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a project that allows me inprove my skills and experience.
