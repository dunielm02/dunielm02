### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I started programming doing most of all competitive programming with the languages C/C++. Because of that, I acquired a love for being face-to-face with hard problems that made me lose sleep. I also like concurrent programming and distributed systems which is the reason why I chose Go as one of my main languages.
